# Competitive Programming Weapon

A minimal and efficient C++ snippet to kickstart competitive programming solutions quickly.

## Less Hastle

- Commonly used headers included (`iostream`, `vector`, `algorithm`, `cmath`, etc.)  
- Type aliases for shorter code (`ll` for `long long`, `vi` for `vector<int>`)  
- Fast I/O setup with `fast_io()` macro for optimized input/output performance  
- Handy macros for common operations:
  - `pb` for `push_back`  
  - `F` and `S` for accessing pair elements  
  - `yes` and `no` for printing "YES" or "NO" quickly  
  - `sort_all` and `reverse_all` to sort or reverse containers easily  
  - `sz` to get container size  
  - `point` for setting decimal precision in output  
- Supports multiple test cases by running the `solve()` function repeatedly  
- Clean, modular, and easy to extend

## Easy To Use

1. Paste the snippet at the top of the solution file.  
2. Write the problem-specific code inside the `solve()` function.  
3. Input the number of test cases; each case will be executed by `solve()` automatically.  
4. Use the macros and typedefs to write code faster and cleaner.
